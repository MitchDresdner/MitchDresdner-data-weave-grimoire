# MitchDresdner-data-weave-grimoire

For a better understanding of how you might use this repository, please see my article [Transformative Moments](https://medium.com/@mjdresdner/transformative-moments-d3f62b6a12fc) 

This repository contains the example code needed for the Dataweave Client **DW CLI**. You can use DW CLI on Linux, Windows and Mac as a data pipeline
to map and transform: XML, JSON, CSV, YAML and Properties to name a few.

If you plan on publishing Grimoire's yourself, there's a specific format which is required. The project must be called *data-weave-grimoire* with your repository
account as the firs part of the name. Mine is called: *MitchDresdner-data-weave-grimoire*. This is a convention, so that DW CLI can find and download your Grimoires.
